## Engineering Challenges Solved

**Performance Optimization**
- Challenge: Handling 2M+ book database with fast search responses
- Solution: Multi-layered Redis caching with intelligent invalidation
- Result: 95% cache hit rate, <100ms average response time

**Memory Management**
- Challenge: Preventing memory overflow on cost-effective EC2 instances
- Solution: Redis LRU eviction policies and real-time monitoring
- Result: Stable operation on 2GB RAM instances

**API Rate Limiting**
- Challenge: Managing OpenLibrary API limits while maintaining UX
- Solution: Request batching, exponential backoff, and fallback mechanisms
- Result: 99.9% uptime with zero rate limit violations

**Scalable Search**
- Challenge: Fast search across millions of books with complex filtering
- Solution: Hybrid search with result caching and weighted ranking
- Result: <200ms search responses with complex filters

---

## Key Technical Achievements

- Achieved 95% cache hit rate through intelligent invalidation strategies
- Reduced average response time to <100ms with multi-layered caching
- Optimized memory usage to <1GB for cost-effective cloud hosting
- Designed system to handle 100,000+ books with consistent performance
